  <hr / />
  <h2 class="text-2xl my-2">TL;DR:</h2>
  <p class="text-lg mr-32">
    ShareBin is a purposefully vulnerable web app built to demonstrate the OWASP
    Top 10 and other web application vulnerabilities. It includes real-world
    flaws like XSS, IDOR, SQL injection, and insecure file uploads. Think of it
    as a playground for learning web security through practice.

  <h2 class="text-2xl my-2">
    Welcome to ShareBin, Your Go-To Platform for (insecure) File and Note
    Sharing.
  </h2>
  <p class="text-lg mr-32">
    Welcome to ShareBin — your go-to platform for (insecure) note and file
    sharing. I'm Louis Ingelbrecht, a second-year Applied Informatics student,
    and I created ShareBin as part of a Security Essentials project. The goal?
    To build an intentionally vulnerable application that demonstrates the most
    common — and dangerous — flaws found in real-world web apps. Whether you're
    learning about cybersecurity or just curious how apps get hacked, ShareBin
    offers a hands-on look at the risks. This platform is not secure — and
    that's exactly the point.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl my-2">Why ShareBin Was Created:</h2>
  <p class="text-lg mr-32">
    For my Security Essentials assignment, I was tasked with analysing and
    documenting the security requirements of an application of my choice. I
    couldn't find a suitable application for this assignment, so I decided to
    create my own. As an IT-student interested in the field of cybersecurity,
    the goal was to create a web application that illustrates common
    vulnerabilities, analyse these security threats and propose/implement
    measures to mitigate these risks. ShareBin is intentionally built to
    showcase how easily an insecure app can expose user data. By exploring this
    project, I aim to highlight key security weaknesses in a way that’s
    interactive and tangible. The purpose of ShareBin isn’t to promote unsafe
    practices, but to demonstrate them and show just how easily attackers can
    exploit poor coding, weak authentication, and lack of encryption. This
    project is also a practical tool for anyone learning about cybersecurity to
    better understand these risks and how to mitigate them in their own work.

    Vulnerabilities Present in ShareBin (OWASP Top 10):
  </h2>
  <p class="text-lg mr-32">
    I have drawn inspiration from the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities to create a
    web application that is intentionally insecure. The following
    vulnerabilities are present in ShareBin:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
    <li>
      <strong>A01 – Broken Access Control:</strong> Users can access files and
      notes belonging to others by modifying URLs (IDOR).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A02 – Cryptographic Failures:</strong> No encryption on files or
      data in transit. Session cookies are also unencrypted.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A03 – Injection:</strong> SQL Injection is possible through the
      search functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A05 – Security Misconfiguration:</strong> Debug mode enabled,
      overly permissive CORS headers, and no security headers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A07 – Identification and Authentication Failures:</strong> Weak
      login, no rate limiting, no MFA, poor session handling.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A08 – Software and Data Integrity Failures:</strong> Users can
      upload and store potentially dangerous files unchecked.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A09 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:</strong> No logs
      or alerts for suspicious behavior like failed logins or access attempts.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-lg mr-32">
    By exploring these vulnerabilities, users can understand how easy it is for
    an attacker to compromise a web application.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg mr-32 my-1">
    <strong>Challenge: </strong>Can you find a vulnerability that isn't listed
    here? Try abusing a feature, escalating privileges, or exfiltrating data. If
    you find a creative exploit — congrats, you just hacked ShareBin.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl my-2">A Note from the Developer:</h2>
  <p class="text-lg mr-32">
    While ShareBin is an intentionally insecure app, its purpose is to serve as
    an educational tool. If you’re exploring this project as part of a
    cybersecurity course or self-study, I encourage you to break the app's
    defences, find any vulnerabilities I haven't mentioned and reflect on each
    security risk. The vulnerabilities I’ve built into ShareBin are real risks
    that often appear in web apps, and understanding them is key to developing
    more secure systems.

  </h2>
  <p class="text-lg mr-32">
    ShareBin is not meant to be deployed in production or used to share real
    files. It is intentionally insecure and designed solely for learning and
    experimentation.
